            </h2>
            <p class="text-font-family font-choco">Finding a balance between conscious choice and intuitive selection is important when working with crystals. While it's helpful to research and learn about different crystals, it's also important to trust our intuition and let it guide us towards the crystals that are right for us. Honoring both our logical mind and our intuition can help us achieve the best results when working with crystals.</p>
            <p class="text-font-family font-choco">Whether we choose crystals or if crystals choose us is a topic that is open to interpretation. However, by exploring the human-crystal connection, choosing crystals that align with our goals and intentions, and tapping into our intuition, we can deepen our understanding of the role crystals play in our lives. By using them with intention and respect, we can harness their powerful energy to achieve greater balance, harmony, and spiritual growth.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="text-font-family font-choco">Larimar's celestial energies are abundant, and the stone is effective in working with all of the higher chakras. It is most often known as a throat chakra stone due to the energy that emanates from it having the color of the ocean, but it is also an excellent partner for the heart chakra, the third eye chakra, and the crown chakra. The stone can help enhance spiritual awareness, emotional healing, and connection to higher beings. Its curative properties may also assist you in establishing a connection to the divine feminine and finding your flow in life.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="text-font-family font-choco mb-18">Larimar is too recent to be called a conventional birthstone, but its energy does seem to connect with those whose birthdays fall at the end of winter or during the transition into spring. This is especially accurate for those whose birthdays fall in the months of February and March. At this time, the gloom of winter begins to dissipate, and the light and hope of spring begin to make their way into the world. It's that time of year when the ice begins to melt and the water is crystal clear.</p>
            <p class="text-font-family font-choco mb-18">It is also possible to relate it to those whose birthdays fall under the sign of Leo. Leos are born when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, giving them a fiery personality. Larimar is a watery balancing stone, and as such, it has the ability to calm the more fiery aspects of the Leo and bring them back into balance</p>
